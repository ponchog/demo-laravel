							Carlos Torres is from Guadalajara, Jalisco, México. He graduated from the School of Plastic Arts of the University of Guadalajara with a B.F.A. He also completed technical studies of painting, acting, dance and music at the

							Preparatory CEDART-Jose Clemente Orosco. In 2002 he participated in the

							Cultural Hospice Cabanas receiving a diploma of Arts for his participation.

							He participated as an assitant in Juan Carlos Macias’ studio, and later with

							the collective engraving “The Tower of the Crickets” as printer’s apprentice.

							He also worked with the professor Conelio Garcia in the printmaking field. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Carlos influences are realistic and figurative painters like Chuck Close,

							Lucian Freud, John Currin, Eric Fischl, Justin Mortimer, Jenny Saville,

							Gottfried Helwein, as well as artists such as Sergio Garval, Juan Carlos

							Macias, Carlos Vargas Pons, Martha Pacheco, Daniel Lezama.
						</p>
						<p>
							Carlos most relevant artwork “Strange Encounters of the Third World”

							(2011), “Sketches Third World”. (2011), “Contemplations” (2013), and

							“Faces see” (2015). He has participated in multiple group exhibitions and

							four solo exhibitions. His latest individual exhibits have been at the Ex

							Convento Del Carmen (Guadalajara, Mexico), Museum Fernando del Paso

							(Colima, Mexico) and Casa Museo Lopez Portillo (Guadalajara, Mexico). 
						</p>
						<p>
							He has been selected and received honorable mention in a variety of

							painting contest such as, prize “Jose Atanasio Monroy” in 2005, 2008 and

							2014; “October’s Salon” in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013. Carlos uses

							his exhibitions as resources in his search for artistic discourse, which

							disrupst events of everyday life in contempotary Mexican society. 
						</p>

						<h3>Justification</h3>
						<p>
							Art is a tool of expression that has been used in various ways, from the

							decorative, narrative, social, intellectual, as a weapon of power, as a flag

							that serves to elevate thinking, creative process and plastic. It is as vast and

							varied as humanity, is complex and vast, this can be a way to get to get as

							an artist&#39;s identity is sought as a person, whatever it is, or the position you

							have.
						</p>
						<p>
							I learned from small to be able to manipulate the clay or clay, but ahead

							thanks to the influence of an uncle, I discovered the world of drawing

							caricature, this led me with great concern to explore slowly portrait and so

							realism, trying to improve my Technique. Subconsciously, from the years I

							was giving me notice this great office that is art, human expression by

							nature, I learned naturally and in doing so fills me with satisfaction, concerns

							and cutaways.
						</p>
						<p>
							The search of my work has been marking inadvertently in a voice that much

							includes social, my tendency to realism generates me direct contact with the

							individual, with my models, with the portrayed objects, their situation in the

							context of the social and toward me. Seen from a status &quot;Cuo&quot;, seen from

							their needs, their excesses, their fears and concerns, which lead me to

							reflect on the canvas, make a remark, a comparison and a connection

							between each person portrait.
						</p>
						<p>
							My creative process is kind of complex; in the series &quot;Faces see&quot; in

							particular, begins with the search for the characters, urban in this case, and

							with a visual contrast between them and the common people. After being

							photographed, the image is treated in different ways, realistic sketches, and

							then the composition of the character by plastic resource that wants to try in

							the piece, in this case, circles, triangles and squares, by way of a pixelaje,

							but interpreted in an analogous manner, carefully observing the color,

							contrast, light, and so on, consequently this gives new ways to represent the

							face in various options.
