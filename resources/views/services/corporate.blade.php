					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>Driven by a deep respect and passion for Latin American art, our founders established Arte International in 2015. The concept was simple yet unique to create an agency that represents Latin American artists to promote their works to the art market in the United States. As a result, Arte International serves as a conduit for Latino artists and galleries. We arrange sales and set up contractual relationships with art dealers. We strive to develop and maintain relationships with the nationâ€™s most respected galleries and corporate buyers. We also assist interior decorators and art collectors who identify and appreciate contemporary Latino art.</p>
